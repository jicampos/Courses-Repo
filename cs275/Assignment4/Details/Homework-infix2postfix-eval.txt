			Homework: infix to postfix

Description: Implement a program that 


 (1) takes as input an infix expression 
 
 (2) outputs the equivalent post-fix expression. The basic algorithm is
   illustrated in figure 6.10: converting an infix expression to a postfix expression  in textbook
 
 (3) Assume that the input may contain unsigned double;  arithmetic operations +, -, *, and /; as well as parentheses. 
     However, the expression need not be fully parenthesized.

 (4) if the expression is well formed, 
      use the "evaluating postfix expressions" outlined in textbook to evlaue the postfix expression
       output the value of the expression
    else 
      print a simple message to indicate the error
 
 (5) Your program should allow the user to enter additional expressions until the user says he or she wishes to end the program. 
 
 (6) test at least the following cases: 
     a. fully parenthesized
     b. not fullly parenthesized
     c. expression with extra (
     d. expression with extra )
     e. the operands can be double or int
     
  (7) you can use the following files in 6.4 as references 
        convertDemonstration.java: 
                     repeatedly converting fully parenthsized infix to postfix 
                     the tokens don't have to be separated by space

                      converting fully parenthsized infix to postfix and 
                     the tokens are separated by space
